# Liam's Internal Website

This website is a personal profile for Liam Hall where I tell you a little bit 
more about myself, my background in academia, some relevant documents that 
relate to my work on GNSS-RO and more.

The purpose of this website is to allow others within the Met Office organisation 
to get to know me and if they have any questions regrading the work I am doing 
but I am out of office, then this website is the go to place to get any 
information they need.

Any more information that is not on my website, or if you have any feedback, 
please let me know via [email](mailto:liam.hall@metoffice.gov.uk) or via Teams 
and I will be more than happy to answer any questions you have.
