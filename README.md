# Liam's Internal Website

This website is a personal profile for Liam Hall where I tell you a little bit 
more about myself, my background in academia, some relevant documents that 
relate to my work on GNSS-RO and more.

The purpose of this website is to allow others within the Met Office organisation 
to get to know me and if they have any questions regrading the work I am doing 
but I am out of office, then this website is the go to place to get any 
information they need.
